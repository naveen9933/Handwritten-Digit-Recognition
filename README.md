# MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition using Deep Learning

This repository contains the code for recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and Keras. The project includes a video demonstration showcasing the code and its corresponding output.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build and train a neural network model to accurately classify handwritten digits. The MNIST dataset is a classic benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning, consisting of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9). 

## Video Demonstration

For a walkthrough of the code and to see the model, watch the video demonstration provided below:

## Getting Started

To run the code locally and reproduce the results:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mnist-digit-recognition.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies. You can use `pip` to install them:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Execute the `mnist_digit_recognition.py` script to train the model and evaluate its performance:

   ```bash
   python mnist_digit_recognition.py
   ```
   
## Results

After training the model, you can expect to achieve impressive accuracy on the MNIST test dataset. The trained model will be able to accurately classify handwritten digits with high confidence.
